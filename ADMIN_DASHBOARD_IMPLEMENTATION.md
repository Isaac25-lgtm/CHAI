## 👥 User Credentials

### Regular User (Limited Access)
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`
- **Access:** Registration, Assessment Tools, Main Portal

### Superuser (Full Admin Access)
- **Username:** `superuser`
- **Password:** `superuser`
- **Access:** Everything + Admin Dashboard at `/admin`

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Login Flow:
1. User visits `http://127.0.0.1:5000` → redirects to `/login`
2. Enter credentials
3. System checks database
4. If **superuser** → redirects to `/admin` (dashboard)
5. If **admin** → redirects to `/` (portal)

### Data Flow:
```
Registration Form → Validate → Save to DB → Generate Excel → Email → Dashboard Updates
Assessment Form → Validate → Save to DB → Generate Excel → Email → Dashboard Updates
```

### Dashboard Updates:
- Stats refresh every 30 seconds via AJAX
- Charts update dynamically with real data from database
- Activity feed shows latest 10 activities
- All exports query database with date filters

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **users** - Authentication
2. **participants** - Registration data
3. **assessments** - Facility assessments
4. **activity_logs** - Audit trail

### Automatic Creation:
Database tables are created automatically on first run. Default users (admin/superuser) are created if they don't exist.

---

## 🚀 Running the System

### Local Development:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py

# Access
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Database File:
- **Local:** Creates `chai_portal.db` in project root (SQLite)
- **Render:** Uses PostgreSQL from `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

---

## 📤 Deployment to Render

### What's Already Configured:
✅ `requirements.txt` - Has `psycopg2-binary` and `gunicorn`
✅ `config.py` - Auto-detects and uses `DATABASE_URL`

✅ Code is production-ready

### Deploy Steps:
1. Push to GitHub ✅ **DONE**
2. Go to render.com
3. New Web Service → Connect GitHub repo
4. Render auto-detects Python
5. Add PostgreSQL database (free tier)
6. Environment variables auto-set
7. Deploy!

### After Deployment:

5. **Email Scheduling** - Automated weekly/monthly reports
6. **Data Visualization** - More chart types (pie, line, etc.)
7. **Mobile App** - Native mobile application
8. **API Keys** - External system integration
9. **Backup System** - Automated database backups
10. **Performance Caching** - Redis for frequently accessed data

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Not Created?
- Check console for errors
- Ensure write permissions in directory
- SQLite creates `chai_portal.db` automatically

### Charts Not Showing Data?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify database has data (submit some forms)
- Check `/api/admin/stats` endpoint directly

### Can't Access Admin Dashboard?
- Ensure logged in as `superuser`
- Regular `admin` user cannot access `/admin`
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Excel Exports Empty?
- Check date range selection
- Ensure data exists in that date range
- Check browser downloads folder
